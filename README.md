# Article Time 
## Chrome extension to show relative time Facebook articles were published

On Facebook, context matters. Every so often, folks will mistakenly share an article on an issue relevant to the current news cycle but later come to learn that it was much older than they previously thought. I wrote this extension to make it easier to identify when this mistake happens.

All you have to do is hover over an article link on your news feed. If a cache of the article is available on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, the relative date will be displayed alongside the article domain.
